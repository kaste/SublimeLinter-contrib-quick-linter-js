SublimeLinter-contrib-quick-lint-js
-----------------------------------

This linter plugin for SublimeLinter provides an interface to quick-lint-js.


Ensure that `quick-lint-js` is actually installed somewhere on your system. For example,


    $ winget install quick-lint-js


on a command line for Windows or


    $ brew install quick-lint-js


on a Mac should do it.  Detailed information can be found here: https://quick-lint-js.com/install/cli/.

After installing make sure you can actually run it. E.g.


    $ quick-lint-js --version


You don't have to install it globally though, as always put the executable wherever you want and point SublimeLinter to it.  For example, in the global settings[1]:


    "linters": {
        "quick-lint-js": {
            "executable": "C:\\Users\\honkytonk\\Downloads\\quick-lint-js\\bin\\quick-lint-js.exe"
        },
        ...


Since `quick-lint-js` is very fast and doesn't use much CPU a lower debounce
time works great for it.  This is also in the global settings[1]:


    {
       "delay": 0.0,
       ...


[1] Open the settings with the Command Palette (`ctrl+shift+P`) searching for `Preferences: SublimeLinter Settings` (mnemonic: `sls`).
